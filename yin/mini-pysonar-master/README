This is a prototype implementation of the PySonar static analyzer for
Python. It has a similar structure as the one I made at Google, but
has a very preliminary status. It is also somewhat simpler and nicer
designed. It has only the core parts (variables, assignments,
functions and calls), but lacks many important things such as objects,
modules etc.

You can find an introduction to the original Google version at:

I currently have no motivation of developing PySonar further. The
purpose of putting this code here is hoping it can be helpful to
people who want to develop static analysis tools for dynamic
languages.
